# CX App Store
Github Repo: skycoin/cx-app-store

CX App Store will be a downloadable app for windows and mac. Once it is downloaded and installed, when ran, the app will start its own local web app server and automatically open up a web browser that redirects to that web app. It will show lists of CX programs/apps/games that the user can run. For example, the user clicks "CXPacman", it will then automatically open up an OpenGL window that runs the CXPacman game.

- Task Bar Launcher (Rudi has working)
- Small web-app
- Server/Redis/Key-value/DHT for packages
- All static files run locally. Runs by JSON files in a directory. All offline?
    â€“ based upon apple: jet a list of apps, with a page for each app; and title+text 

Interface:
- Game runs with OpenGl window (most existing apps are games)
- Eventually: iPython notebook + terminal interface for interacting?
